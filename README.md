# Django contenteditable #

With django-contenteditable you can easily create Django apps that use the powerful HTML `contenteditable` attribute.
Contenteditable is supported by all non-mobile browsers, including Internet Explorer (see http://caniuse.com/#feat=contenteditable).

With django-contenteditable you can create simple and easy to use admin interfaces to allow your human users to edit/add/delete contents directly where they view them, without a backend site (e.g.: django.contrib.admin).

## Current status ##
A big update has been pushed and I'll publish a new README file tomorrow evening (GMT).
